## Hi there! 👋🏼

**My name is Eric Hansen** and I'm a data scientist, educator, mathematician, and physicist and a recent graduate of the Flatiron School and the Coursera Deep Learning Specialization. I have taught for over ten years at the college and high school levels, in mathematics, computer science and physics. I loved designing experiences for students that lead them to ask questions, investigate for deeper understanding, and develop their passions. I also worked for seven years in healthcare Actuarial Science, in both consulting and not-for-profit companies.  In both of these settings, I gained extensive experience translating technical concepts for non-technical audiences. 

I branched out into data science and machine learning because I find the underlying mathematics to be fascinating and incredibly powerful, and I want to bring those powerful tools to empower and help others.

### What I'm up to:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [Project Euler top 100 problems](https://projecteuler.net/archives/) and [CodeWars!](https://www.codewars.com/users/mechafish)
- 🌱 I’m also working on a website and regression model for advising players and teams in League of Legends!
- 👯 Open to collaborate on data and machine learning projects that tell interesting stories and/or have a social impact
- 💬 Ask me about neural networks for image classification with Keras/Tensorflow, natural language processing, and medical diagnosis
- 🗽 Atlanta-based, remote-work-friendly
- 🥅 Goal: Black belt in Taekwondo!
